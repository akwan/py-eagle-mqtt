## TODO
1. Need to add variables for username/password, in case anyone is using authentication with their broker
1. Need to try and port original code to Python 3.x
1. Make sure Dockerhub is set up to build when I want it to
1. Look for ways to optimize the Dockerfile to reduce image size
1. Try to get more stats from the Eagle ($/kWh from the meter, etc.)
1. Stuff


Any help anyone wants to provide, please submit a PR. I'm new to Dockerfiles so I'm sure a lot can be done.
